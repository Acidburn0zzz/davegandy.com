        <h1><a href="./">A Drunk Frat Boy, Some Cake, and a Multi-Line Title</a></h1>
        <p>This past Friday night, <a href="http://www.cakemusic.com/">Cake</a> came to MIT for the annual spring weekend concert. There aren't many bands whose every song I have memorized, but Cake is one. The set was great, and I especially enjoyed hearing renditions of "Stickshifts and Safetybelts" and "Sheep Go to Heaven". The music was great, and I love the lead singer's completely beat up guitar. It had duct or gaffers tape on it. Impressive. The entire time I was wishing I had been able to get a press pass to shoot the scene. It was driving me crazy. It's been quite some time since I've been to a concert or play and have not had my camera at my side.</p>
        <p>But there was something else that was annoying. There was this frat guy with 4 or 5 of his frat brothers that was causing all kinds of problems near us. He was very drunk, and kept shoving his brothers into other folks in the crowd. His brothers were egging him on, yet apologizing when they ran into others. They were totally using him to cause problems and not have to take any responsibility for themselves. Pretty genius, really.</p>
        <p>But there came a point that I got sick of this kid. I got sick of getting shoved and not being able to enjoy the concert, and I was in a bit of a mood that night. I was contemplating what to do when it all came together. He stumbled near me, and I grabbed him, wrapping my arms completely around him. His arms were at his side, and he was wriggling trying to get free. But he couldn't. I held him for an entire song, and he never got free. After he calmed down a bit, I let him go.</p>
        <p>His frat brothers were teasing him, and he was quite embarassed. For the rest of the concert, he was cursing at me and questioning my sexual orientation somewhat graphically. But he calmed down, and that was pretty much that.</p>
        <p>It was fun to embarrass the frat boy.</p>
